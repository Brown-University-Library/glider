    GLIDER DEMO: PHASES

    This is a simple demo of Glider "Phases". It is meant as a
    starting point for those who want to get a sense of the project.

    Phases define periods of time. They are associated with Parts, and tell Parts when they are active.
 
    Phases can be simple - periods that start and end. 

    Phases can also act as containers for other Phases. These containers are either:

      - parallel (that is, the contained Phases run concurrently) or 
      - sequential (the contained Phases run in order, from the first to the last)

    Phases have duration (specified in seconds by the phase-duration attribute); 
    if unspecified, the duration is INFINITY.

    Phases also can be delayed (specified in seconds by the phase-begin attribute).

    Note that Glider's Phases were inspired by the SMIL standard, particularly
    the chapter on Timing and Synchronization: https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/smil-timing.html

    NOTE: THIS IS NOT A STABLE FILE!

    As the project progresses, this file will be updated and refined.
