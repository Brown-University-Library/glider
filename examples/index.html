    The following are pages that demonstrate the basics of
    the Glider architecture.

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Glider is structured around a 3-part model:
    <!-- <em>Parts</em> (components) into 
      <em>Places</em> (display-devices) at <em>Phases</em> (time periods). -->
  </p>

  <h2>Places</h2>
  <p><em>Places</em> are are devices with displays.
    For example, a Place could be a display wall, or a
    presenter’s laptop, or an audience’s smartphones.

        <h3>
          Place Types
        </h3>
        <p>
          Places come in different <em>Place Types</em>,
          which are tailored for genres of display (such as
          display walls or smartphones).</p>
        <p>Currently, there are just two defined Place
          Types:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>FixedGridPlace</dt>
          <dd>is particularly suited for
            <a
              href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-humanities/sites/public-humanities/files/Lab2-16-web_0.jpg">display
              walls with a bezel grid</a></dd>
          <dt>BootstrapPlace</dt>
          <dd>automatically loads the responsive BootStrap
            CSS framework, and is well-suited for general
            browser display</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          <em>There will most certainly be other Place Types
            introduced in the future, for example a Type to
            handle <a
              href="https://acwm.org/blog/digital-solution-problem-paper">non-contiguous
              displays</a>.</em>

        <h3>
          Place Regions
        </h3>
        <p>
          A Place can have <em>Regions</em>, which are
          selected areas of a Place.
        </p>
        <p>
          What exactly constitutes a "region" depends on the
          Place Type. For example, a
          <code>FixedGridPlace</code> considers regions to
          be rectangular cell ranges, and the region
          names specify the row, column, width, and height
          within the grid.

  <h3>
    Place examples
  </h3>

  <p>
    The following buttons link to the same Glider flight
    (located at <code>place-example.html</code>) &mdash;
    the only difference is that
    the URL takes the browser to 3 different Places, which
    are specified according to the
    following pattern:
    <code>#/&lt;FLIGHT INSTANCE ID&gt;/&lt;PLACE ID&gt;</code>
  </p>
  <p>(We've arbitrarily assigned the Flight Instance ID to
    1234)</p>
  <p>
    <em>Please view the source HTML code to see how each is
      expressed in markup.</em>
  </p>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="list-group list-group-flush"
      style="width: 100%">
      <a class="list-group-item"
        href="place-example.html#/1234/good">
        <strong>The Good Place</strong><br />
        <code>place-example.html#/1234/good</code>
      </a>
      <a class="list-group-item"
        href="place-example.html#/1234/bad">
        <strong>The Bad Place</strong><br />
        <code>place-example.html#/1234/bad</code>
      </a>
      <a class="list-group-item"
        href="place-example.html#/1234/wall">
        <strong>The Wall Place</strong><br />
        <code>place-example.html#/1234/wall</code><br />
        <em>formatted for a diplay wall with a 3&times;4
          grid of 1080p monitors (scaled to 10%)</em>
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Parts</h2>
  <p>
    Parts are modules/objects/components that have state and
    function. All elements in a Glider flight are
    Parts (even simple HTML elements have a Part assigned to
    them).
  </p>
  <p>
    Parts are <code>active</code> or <code>inactive</code>,
    depending on the associated Phase (see below).
  </p>
  <p>
    Parts do not appear in the page; their <em>Part
      Views</em> do. Part Views are the expression of the
    Part,
    and a single Part can have many Part Views &mdash; for
    example, a slide carousel Part may have one Part View
    for viewing the images (e.g. on a display wall) and
    another Part View for a user to advance the slides using
    their
    mobile device.
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
    <em>Note that Parts are VueJS components.</em> As such,
    Glider is meant to be easily extended by leveraging this
    popular
    library.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Part Example
  </h3>
  <p>
    The following simple example is a color selector. The
    <code>controller</code> Part View is the controller,
    while the <code>display</code> Part View shows the
    result. In order to see the Part in action, you need to
    view both Places (either in two different devices or two
    browser windows).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Please view the source HTML code to see how each is
      expressed in markup.</em>
  </p>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="list-group list-group-flush"
      style="width: 100%">
      <a class="list-group-item"
        href="part-example.html#/1234/mobile"
        target="_BLANK">
        <strong>Mobile Part View</strong>
      </a>
      <a class="list-group-item"
        href="part-example.html#/1234/wall" target="_BLANK">
        <strong>Display Part View</strong>
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Phases</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Phases</em> define periods of time during which
    Parts are active.</p>
  <p>Some are simple
    periods that start and end. Others are compound Phases
    that contain other Phases.
    These compound Phases (the SMIL standard calls them Time
    Containers) are either
    parallel (that is, the child Phases run concurrently) or
    sequential (the child Phases run
    in order, from the first to the last child).
  </p>
  <p>
    Phases have duration (specified in seconds by the
    <code>phase-duration</code> attribute) &mdash; if
    unspecified, the duration is INFINITY.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phases also can be delayed (specified in seconds by the
    <code>phase-begin</code> attribute).
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
    Phases are loosely based on the SMIL standard,
    particularly the <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/smil-timing.html">
      Timing and Synchronization</a> chapter.
  </div>
  <h3>
    Phases Example
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is a simple example of Phases being used to display
    different text over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main Phase (a sequence), contains a parallel Phase,
    which in turn contains a sequence Phase.
