    <h1 class="display-1">Glider examples</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      The following are pages that demonstrate the basics of the Glider architecture.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
      Please note that these pages are, like Glider as a whole, in an alpha stage of release.
    </div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Glider has a metaphor of putting <em>Parts</em> (components) into 
      <em>Places</em> (display-devices) at <em>Phases</em> (time periods).
    </p>
    <p>The following links demonstrate each of these in turn. 
      Please view the source HTML code to see how each is expressed in markup.</p>
     
    <h2>Place example</h2>
    <p><em>Places</em> are are devices with displays.
      For example, a Place could be a display wall, or a presenter’s laptop, or an audience’s smartphones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Places come in different <em>Place Types</em>, which are tailored for genres of display (such as display walls or smartphones).
    </p>
    <p>
      A Place can have <em>Regions</em>, which are selected areas of a Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following buttons link to the same Glider flight (located at <code>place-example.html</code>) &mdash; 
      the only difference is that 
      the URL takes the browser to 3 different Places, which are specified according to the 
      following pattern: <code>#/&lt;FLIGHT INSTANCE ID>/&lt;PLACE ID></code>
    </p>
    <p>(We've arbitrarily assigned the Flight Instance ID to 1234)</p>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="list-group list-group-flush" style="width: 100%">
        <a class="list-group-item" href="place-example.html#/1234/good">
              <strong>The Good Place</strong><br />
              <code>place-example.html#/1234/good</code>
        </a>
        <a class="list-group-item" href="place-example.html#/1234/bad">
          <strong>The Bad Place</strong><br />
          <code>place-example.html#/1234/bad</code>
        </a>
        <a class="list-group-item" href="place-example.html#/1234/wall">
          <strong>The Wall Place</strong><br />
          <code>place-example.html#/1234/wall</code><br />
          <em>formatted for a diplay wall with a 3&times;4 grid of 1080p monitors (scaled to 10%)</em>
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Parts example</h2>
    <p>
      Parts are modules/objects/components that have state and function. All elements in a Glider flight are
      Parts (even simple HTML elements have a Part assigned to them).
    </p> 
    <p>
      Parts are <code>active</code> or <code>inactive</code>, depending on the associated Phase (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Parts do not appear in the page; their <em>Part Views</em> do. Part Views are the expression of the Part, 
      and a single Part can have many Part Views &mdash; for example, a slide carousel Part may have one Part View 
      for viewing the images (e.g. on a display wall) and another Part View for a user to advance the slides using their
      mobile device.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note that Parts are VueJS components.</em> As such, Glider is meant to be easily extended by leveraging this popular
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following simple example is a color selector. The <code>controller</code> Part View is the controller, 
      while the <code>display</code> Part View shows the result. In order to see the Part in action, you need to 
      view both Places (either in two different devices or two browser windows).
    </p>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="list-group list-group-flush" style="width: 100%">
          <a class="list-group-item" href="part-example.html#/1234/mobile">
            <strong>Mobile Part View</strong>
          </a>
          <a class="list-group-item" href="part-example.html#/1234/wall">
            <strong>Display Part View</strong>
          </a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Phases example</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Phases</em> define periods of time during which Parts are active.</p>
      <p>Some are simple
      periods that start and end. Others are compound Phases that contain other Phases.
      These compound Phases (the SMIL standard calls them Time Containers) are either 
      parallel (that is, the child Phases run concurrently) or sequential (the child Phases run
      in order, from the first to the last child).
    </p>
    <p>
      Phases have duration (specified in seconds by the <code>phase-duration</code> attribute) &mdash; if unspecified, the duration is INFINITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phases also can be delayed (specified in seconds by the <code>phase-begin</code> attribute).
    </p>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="list-group list-group-flush" style="width: 100%">
          <a class="list-group-item" href="phase-example.html">
            <strong>Phase example</strong><br />
            In which a main sequence Phase contains a parallel Phase, which in turn contains a sequence Phase.
          </a>
