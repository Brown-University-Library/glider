Glider
=================

This is the development area for [Glider](http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/glider/), an open source project that aims to support those building display-wall applications. 

The Glider framework allows for multiple use cases, including:

* Interactive digital exhibits, with which viewers interact via a touch controller (kiosk-style) or cell phones
* Digitally enhanced collaborative classes, in which content and shared documents are pushed to students
* Participatory presentations, in which audiences receive supplemental materials as the lecture is delivered
* Digital repository viewing interfaces, in which users interactively select and display items on the display wall using their cell phone

Glider is a project of the [Brown University Library](http://library.brown.edu), and is being developed by Patrick Rasheigh (Brown University Library) and Joel Salisbury (University of Connecticut). It is funded by, and a proud member of, the Mellon-funded [Immersive Scholar project](https://www.immersivescholar.org/) at [NCSU Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/).

Probably more than you want to know is available for perusal at [the Glider website](http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/glider/), and please feel free to throw us an email: `patrick underscore rashleigh at brown dot edu`.
